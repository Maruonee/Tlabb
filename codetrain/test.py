"""
Again, the code is broken, you need to create 4 functions.
  - add_to_dict: Add a word to a dict.
  - get_from_dict: Get a word from inside a dict.
  - update_word: Update a word inside of the dict.
  - delete_from_dict: Delete a word from the dict.

All this functions should check for errors, follow the comments to see all cases you need to cover.

There should be NO ERRORS from Python in the console.
